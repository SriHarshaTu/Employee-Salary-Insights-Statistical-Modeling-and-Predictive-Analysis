# 💼 Employee Salary Insights Statistical Modeling and Predictive Analysis

This project investigates salary patterns in the data science field using a dataset that includes variables such as gender, job title, education, years of experience, and salary. The goal is to explore disparities (e.g., gender or role-based), evaluate factors that influence salary, and build predictive models that help students and professionals understand earning potential in data-driven careers.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Explore salary trends across demographic and job-related variables.
- Investigate gender-based and job-title-based salary gaps using hypothesis testing.
- Predict salary using regression modeling based on years of experience.
- Provide actionable insights for job seekers and HR professionals in data science.

## 🧪 Methods & Techniques

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distributions of salary across gender and job titles
- Boxplots, histograms, and summary statistics
- Outlier detection and treatment

### 2. **Confidence Intervals**
- Estimating salary averages for subgroups with CI
- Quantifying estimate reliability

### 3. **Hypothesis Testing**
- **Q1**: Is there a significant salary difference between genders?
- **Q2**: Do Data Scientists earn more than Data Analysts?
- Statistical methods: t-tests, visual comparisons

### 4. **Regression Modeling**
- **Simple Linear Regression**: Salary ~ Years of Experience
- **Model Diagnostics**: R², residual plots, normality, homoscedasticity
- **Next Step**: **Multiple Linear Regression** including Education & Job Title

## 🧠 Key Findings

- 📈 Salary strongly increases with years of experience but at a diminishing rate.
- ⚖️ Some evidence of a gender-based pay gap, though statistical significance may vary.
- 🧪 Data Scientists, on average, earn more than Data Analysts, even when controlling for experience.
- 🔍 The regression model shows good fit (high R²) and useful predictive value.
